# Music-note-classification-on-Musicnet-Dataset
## Introduction:
- MusicNet  is  a  collection  of  330  freely  licensed  classical  music  recordings,  together  with  over  1 
million annotated  labels indicating the precise time of  each note in  every recording,  the 
instrument  that  plays  each  note,  and  the  note's  position  in  the  metrical  structure  of  the 
composition. 
- The labels are acquired from musical scores aligned to recordings by dynamic time 
warping. 
- The  labels  are  verified  by  trained  musicians;  a  labelling  error  rate  of  4%  has  been 
estimated.
- The MusicNet labels are offered to the machine learning and music communities as a 
resource for training models and a common benchmark for comparing results. 


## Concepts and Skills used:
- Machine  Learning
- Python  Programming  Language  - Classification  Techniques  - Python  Packages, 
- Python IDE (Any)


## Acknowledgements:
- The  MusicNet  labels  apply  exclusively  to  Creative  Commons  and  Public  Domain  recordings,  and  as 
such  we  can  distribute  and  re-distribute  the  MusicNet  labels  together  with  their  corresponding 
recordings.
- The music that underlies MusicNet is sourced from the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the European Archive, and Musopen.  
- This  work  was  supported  by  the  Washington  Research  Foundation  Fund  for  Innovation  in  Data-Intensive Discovery, and the program "Learning in Machines and Brains" (CIFAR).
